Migrating code from old cgit repo to Stash, 9/25/14.

Due to large data files in the old repos, I'm pruning this down and tossing the file histories.  For the histories, go see the original repos at:
LSST/sims/selfcal/analysis.git	
LSST/sims/selfcal/generation.git
LSST/sims/atmosphere/clouds.git	
LSST/sims/atmosphere/transmission.git

I'm not pulling over the giant papers found here:
LSST/sims/doc.git
